## Superpowers Integration

At the START of every conversation, run:

```bash
node ~/.codex/superpowers-augment/superpowers-augment.js bootstrap
```

### Key Skills

| Skill | When to Invoke |
|-------|---------------|
| `superpowers:brainstorming` | Before creative/feature work |
| `superpowers:systematic-debugging` | Before fixing bugs |
| `superpowers:test-driven-development` | Before writing implementation |
| `superpowers:verification-before-completion` | Before committing, creating PRs, or claiming done |
| `superpowers:writing-plans` | Before multi-step tasks |
| `superpowers:requesting-code-review` | Before creating PRs or merging to main |
| `superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch` | When completing work (merge/PR/cleanup decisions) |

**The Rule**: IF A SKILL APPLIES (even 1% chance), YOU MUST INVOKE IT.

## Communication Standards

- **No flattery** - Skip "Great question!" or "Excellent point!"
- **No hype words** - Avoid "revolutionary", "game-changing", "cutting-edge"
- **Evidence-based** - Cite sources, provide data, or qualify as opinion
- **Direct** - State facts without embellishment

### Banned Phrases

| Category | Avoid |
|----------|-------|
| Self-Promotion | production-grade, world-class, enterprise-ready |
| Filler | incredibly, extremely, very, really, truly |
| AI Tells | leverage, utilize, facilitate, streamline, optimize |
| Sycophancy | Happy to help!, Absolutely!, I appreciate... |

## Project-Specific Rules

<!-- Add project-specific guidance below this line -->

## 💰 COST-CONSCIOUS SEARCH POLICY (GLOBAL)

<EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>
**Perplexity API calls cost real money from personal funds. Always use free tools first.**

### Escalation Path

1. **Step 1 (FREE):** Use `web-search` for all lookups
2. **Step 2 (FREE):** Use `web-fetch` to check URLs or read pages directly
3. **Step 3 (EVALUATE):** Ask yourself — did I find what I need? If YES → STOP
4. **Step 4 (PAID):** Only if results are ≥50% worse than expected, escalate to Perplexity

### Before Calling Perplexity

You MUST state explicitly:
> "web-search returned [X]. This is insufficient because [reason]. Escalating to Perplexity."

### Cost Reference

| Tool | Cost | Use When |
|------|------|----------|
| `web-search` | FREE | Always first |
| `web-fetch` | FREE | Checking URLs, reading pages |
| `perplexity_ask_perplexity` | ~$0.001/query | Simple questions after web-search fails |
| `perplexity_search_perplexity` | ~$0.005/query | Search after web-search fails |
| `perplexity_reason_perplexity` | ~$0.01/query | Complex reasoning (rare) |
| `perplexity_research_perplexity` | ~$0.05/query | Deep research (very rare, ask first) |

### Never Call Perplexity For

- Simple company lookups
- Checking if a URL is live
- Finding a company's website
- Basic fact-checking
- Reading documentation pages

### Acceptable Perplexity Use Cases

- Complex multi-source synthesis after web-search fails
- Current events/news that web-search can't find
- Technical questions requiring reasoning
- When user explicitly requests Perplexity
