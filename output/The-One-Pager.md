# Distilling Clarity: The One-Pager

*The fastest way to get unstuck is to write it down in one page.*

You know the feeling: a project idea is swirling in your head, but you can't quite articulate it. You're not sure where to start, what to prioritize, or how to explain it to someone else. You're stuck.

The One-Pager is my go-to tool for breaking that paralysis. It does two things:

1. **Clarifies your own thinking.** The constraint of a single page forces you to identify what actually matters. You can't hide behind length. Gaps in your logic become obvious.

2. **Gets a group moving together.** Once it's on paper, you have something concrete to react to, debate, and improve. Instead of circular discussions about abstract ideas, the team can point at specific words and align.

> [!TIP]
> The One-Pager isn't just a communication tool. It's a *thinking* tool. The act of writing one often reveals gaps in your own understanding that no amount of internal deliberation would uncover.

## What is a One-Pager?

A One-Pager is a document that summarizes a topic to, as the name implies, a single page. But calling it "just a summary" misses the point. It's a forcing function for clear thinking. If you can't explain your idea compellingly in one page, the idea probably isn't ready for investment.

The real value isn't in the brevity itself, but in the discipline it requires. One-pagers force you to identify what actually matters and distinguish between problems and solutions.

> [!WARNING]
> While a One-Pager is concise, it is not a replacement for detailed project plans or specifications. It is a starting point, not the entire journey.

## When to Use (and Not Use) a One-Pager

The key to effective one-pager usage isn't following a rigid checklist. It's understanding when clarity and alignment matter more than comprehensiveness.

### ✅ Use a One-Pager For:

  * **Project Proposals:** Quickly outline a new project's goals, scope, and expected benefits to get initial buy-in.
  * **Feature Summaries:** Clearly define the problem, proposed solution, and success metrics for a new product feature.
  * **Stakeholder Alignment:** Ensure everyone from engineering to marketing has a consistent understanding of a project's objectives.
  * **Executive Briefings:** Provide leadership with a concise summary for quick decision-making.

### ❌ Skip a One-Pager For:

  * **Deeply Technical Specifications:** When detailed technical documentation is required.
  * **Comprehensive Project Plans:** When you need a detailed breakdown of tasks, timelines, and resource allocation.
  * **Bug Reports:** When a simple ticket with clear steps to reproduce is more effective.
  * **Replacing a Conversation:** It should prompt discussion, not prevent it.

A good test: If you can't explain the core idea on a single page, the idea itself may not be focused enough yet.

## The One-Pager vs. The PR-FAQ

While both are powerful alignment tools, the One-Pager and the PR-FAQ (Press Release - Frequently Asked Questions) serve different purposes and are used at different stages.

| **Aspect** | **One-Pager** | **PR-FAQ** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Goal** | Achieve internal alignment on the *what* and *why* of a project. | Work backwards from the customer to define a product's value proposition *before* building. |
| **Audience** | Primarily internal stakeholders (team members, leadership). | Internal team, but written from the perspective of an external customer. |
| **Core Focus** | Problem, proposed solution, and scope. | Customer-centric narrative and benefits. |
| **When to Use** | Early-stage ideation, project kick-offs, feature proposals. | New product development or major initiatives with unclear customer value. |
| **Key Output** | A concise summary to facilitate a "go/no-go" decision. | A detailed vision that guides the entire product development process. |

In essence, a One-Pager is often a precursor to more detailed documents. A successful One-Pager might lead to the decision to write a full PR-FAQ for a major new initiative.

## Anatomy of an Effective One-Pager

A compelling One-Pager is more than just a brain dump. It tells a clear and concise story.

### One-Pager Template Structure

| **Section** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Project/Feature Name** | A clear, descriptive title. |
| **Problem Statement** | What specific customer or business problem are you solving? Quantify it if possible. |
| **Proposed Solution** | A high-level description of how you will solve the problem. Avoid technical jargon. |
| **Key Goals/Benefits** | What are the measurable outcomes? (e.g., "Reduce user onboarding time by 50%"). |
| **Scope (and Out-of-Scope)**| What is explicitly included in this effort? Equally important, what is *not* included to prevent scope creep? |
| **Success Metrics**| How will you know you've succeeded? List 2-3 key performance indicators (KPIs). |
| **Key Stakeholders** | Who are the owners, approvers, and key contributors? |
| **Timeline Estimate** | A rough, high-level timeline for major milestones. |

### Writing Tips

  * **Be Ruthlessly Concise:** Use bullet points and simple language. If a sentence doesn't add critical value, cut it.
  * **Focus on the Why:** Start with the problem. If the "why" isn't compelling, the "what" and "how" don't matter. Keep outcomes and implementation properly separated.
  * **Use Visuals Sparingly:** A simple diagram or chart can be effective, but don't clutter the page.
  * **Collaborate:** Write it with key stakeholders to build early alignment.

## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

The failure patterns repeat across organizations. Here are the mistakes that kill one-pagers before they can do their job:

### Mistake 1: The Wall of Text

**Problem:** Long, dense paragraphs that are difficult to scan.

**Fix:** Use headings, subheadings, and bullet points to structure the information for easy consumption.

### Mistake 2: The "Everything but the Kitchen Sink"

**Problem:** Trying to cram every detail onto one page, defeating the purpose of a summary.

**Fix:** Be disciplined. If it's not essential to the core idea, leave it out or link to a more detailed document.

### Mistake 3: Vague Goals

**Problem:** Using fuzzy terms like "improve user experience" or "increase efficiency."

**Fix:** Define success with specific, measurable, and time-bound goals. (e.g., "Increase user engagement, measured by daily active users, by 15% in Q3."). Avoid weasel words and vague language.

### Mistake 4: Confusing Features with Benefits

**Problem:** Listing what your solution *does* instead of what it *achieves* for the user or business.

**Fix:** For every feature, ask "So what?" to uncover the real benefit.

## Making One-Pagers Work in Your Organization

The process around one-pagers matters as much as the content. Organizations that treat them as thinking tools rather than compliance documents ship faster and kill bad ideas earlier.

### The Review Process

1.  **Draft:** The project lead or sponsor drafts the initial One-Pager.
2.  **Collaborate:** Share the draft with key stakeholders for input and refinement.
3.  **Review:** Hold a brief meeting (30 minutes max) to discuss the One-Pager and make a "go/no-go" decision.
4.  **Approve & Share:** Once approved, the One-Pager becomes the official, easily shareable summary for the project.

### The Power of "No"

The most valuable outcome of a One-Pager process is often the decision *not* to proceed. If you can't articulate a compelling case on a single page, it's a strong signal that the idea needs more thought or should be abandoned, saving the organization valuable time and resources.

The discipline of the One-Pager pays off: clearer proposals, faster decisions, fewer wasted projects.
