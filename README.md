# superpowers-plus

Extended domain skills for [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) by Jesse Vincent — wiki editing, issue tracking, security audits, and more.

**⚠️ Prerequisite:** This extends obra/superpowers (installed automatically by our installer).

## Installation

**Note:** Installation differs by platform. Claude Code and Cursor have built-in plugin marketplaces. Codex and OpenCode require manual setup.

### Claude Code (via Plugin Marketplace)

Register the marketplace, then install **both** plugins:

```bash
# One-time: Register the marketplace
/plugin marketplace add bordenet/superpowers-plus

# Install prerequisite (obra/superpowers)
/plugin install superpowers@superpowers-plus

# Install extended skills
/plugin install superpowers-plus@superpowers-plus
```

> ⚠️ **Untested:** This plugin marketplace flow has not been end-to-end validated. If you encounter issues, use the Manual Installation method below.

### Cursor (via Plugin Marketplace)

In Cursor Agent chat:

```text
/add-plugin superpowers-plus
```

Or search for "superpowers-plus" in the plugin marketplace.

**Note:** You must also install obra/superpowers separately for the full experience.

### Codex

Tell Codex:

```text
Fetch and follow instructions from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bordenet/superpowers-plus/refs/heads/main/.codex/INSTALL.md
```

**Detailed docs:** [.codex/INSTALL.md](.codex/INSTALL.md)

### OpenCode

Tell OpenCode:

```text
Fetch and follow instructions from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bordenet/superpowers-plus/refs/heads/main/.opencode/INSTALL.md
```

**Detailed docs:** [.opencode/INSTALL.md](.opencode/INSTALL.md)

### Gemini CLI

> **Note:** Gemini CLI support is based on obra/superpowers documentation. Verify current syntax with `gemini --help`.

```bash
# Install prerequisite first
gemini extensions install https://github.com/obra/superpowers

# Then install superpowers-plus
gemini extensions install https://github.com/bordenet/superpowers-plus
```

### Manual Installation (Shell Script)

For environments without plugin marketplaces:

**macOS / Linux / WSL:**
```bash
# Install prerequisite (if not already installed)
git clone https://github.com/obra/superpowers.git ~/.codex/superpowers

# Install superpowers-plus
git clone https://github.com/bordenet/superpowers-plus.git
cd superpowers-plus
./install.sh
```

**Windows (WSL — Recommended):**
```bash
# In Ubuntu terminal (not PowerShell)
git clone https://github.com/bordenet/superpowers-plus.git
cd superpowers-plus
./install.sh
```

> 💡 **Windows users:** Use **Ubuntu on WSL** (`wsl --install -d Ubuntu`). Native PowerShell has path translation issues.

### Verify Installation

For manual installations, verify skills are installed:

```bash
node ~/.codex/superpowers-augment/superpowers-augment.js find-skills
```

Then start a new session and ask for something that should trigger a skill (e.g., "help me write a wiki page" or "check this issue for problems"). The agent should automatically invoke the relevant skill.

## Trigger Validation

Skills include machine-readable `triggers:` arrays for automated auditing:

```yaml
---
name: link-verification
source: superpowers-plus
triggers: ["verify links", "check URL", "add code reference"]
description: Use when adding URLs to documentation...
---
```

Run the trigger validator to audit your skill registry:

```bash
# Full audit (overlaps, missing triggers, registry summary)
./tools/skill-trigger-validator.sh audit

# Check for trigger collisions only
./tools/skill-trigger-validator.sh overlaps

# Generate skill → trigger mapping
./tools/skill-trigger-validator.sh registry
```

### Downstream Overrides

When extending superpowers-plus, downstream skills can declare their override relationship:

```yaml
---
name: link-verification
source: your-org-repo
overrides: superpowers-plus/link-verification
triggers: [...]
---
```

This enables tooling to audit which version is active at runtime.

| Wiki skills fail | Wiki API not configured | Set `WIKI_PLATFORM` in `.env`, see `skills/wiki/_adapters/` |

## Extending for Enterprise

> 📖 **Comprehensive Guide:** See [Enterprise Adopters Guide](docs/ENTERPRISE_ADOPTERS_GUIDE.md) for detailed patterns including override, adapter, fork, and rules patterns.

superpowers-plus is designed as a **base layer** that organizations can extend with their own skills.

### Layered Architecture

Built on top of [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers):

```
obra/superpowers (framework)
    └── superpowers-plus (generic skills - this repo)
            └── your-org-skills (org-specific skills)
```

### How to Extend

1. **Fork or create a separate repo** for organization-specific skills
2. **Install superpowers-plus first** as the base layer (installs to `~/.codex/skills/`)
3. **Install your org skills second** to `~/.codex/superpowers/skills/` — this path takes precedence, so org skills override matching base skill names

### Example: Enterprise Extension

```bash
# Step 1: Install base layer
cd ~/superpowers-plus && ./install.sh

# Step 2: Install org-specific layer (installs to ~/.codex/superpowers/skills/)
cd ~/my-org-skills && ./install.sh
```

Your org's skills can:
- **Override** generic skills with customized versions (same name, different behavior)
- **Add** org-specific skills that don't exist in superpowers-plus
- **Reference** shared modules from superpowers-plus

### What Belongs Where

| superpowers-plus | Your Org Repo |
|------------------|---------------|
| Generic issue tracking (`issue-*`) | Platform-specific (`linear-*`, `jira-*`) |
| Generic wiki editing | Org wiki URLs and workflows |
| TypeScript patterns | Org coding conventions |
| Research skills | Org-specific integrations |
