# Issue Authoring

> **Purpose:** Ensure consistent, high-quality issues with verified fields
> **Adapter:** See `_adapters/` for platform-specific configuration
>
> **Wrong skill?** Updating existing issues → `issue-editing`. Verifying issue identifiers → `issue-verify`. Adding comments → `issue-comment-debunker`.

---

## When to Use

- Creating new tickets in your configured issue tracker (shipped adapters: GitHub Issues, Jira; custom adapters supported via `skills/issue-tracking/_adapters/platform-template.md`)
- When user requests a ticket for a bug, feature, or task
- Converting conversation discussion into a trackable ticket
- When acceptance criteria need to be formalized

## Configuration

Before using this skill, configure your issue tracker:

1. Set `ISSUE_TRACKER_TYPE` to your configured issue-tracker adapter key
2. See `skills/issue-tracking/_adapters/` for platform-specific setup
3. Ensure required MCP tools are available for your platform

## Pre-Creation Checklist (MANDATORY)

Before calling your adapter's `create_issue` operation:

- [ ] **Search for duplicates** — Use adapter's search operation
- [ ] **Validate labels exist** — Query label IDs for your platform
- [ ] **Validate assignee exists** — Query user IDs for your platform
- [ ] **Verify issue cross-references** — For **issue identifiers or issue URLs** in the description (e.g., `Related: [IDENTIFIER]`, `Closes: [URL]`), run `issue-verify` or `issue-link-verification` first; reject any where `exists:false` or `entityType != "issue"`. PR links, wiki links, repo URLs, and external references do not go through this check — use `issue-link-verification`'s type-specific policy for those.
- [ ] **Title follows format** — See Title Standards below
- [ ] **Description has required sections** — See Description Template

---

## Title Standards

<EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>

| Pattern | Example | Status |
|---------|---------|--------|
| `[Type]: Brief description` | `Bug: Phone call drops after 30s on slow networks` | ✅ GOOD |
| `Specific, actionable title` | `Add retry logic to webhook handler` | ✅ GOOD |
| `Fix bug` | — | ❌ TOO VAGUE |
| `Update thing` | — | ❌ TOO VAGUE |
| `Issue with X` | — | ❌ TOO VAGUE |

**Title must be:**

- Specific enough to understand without reading description
- Max 80 characters (Some trackers truncate longer titles in views)
- No tracker-managed identifier prefix (added automatically by the tracker)

</EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>

---

## Description Template

```markdown
## Context
[What problem are we solving? Why does this matter?]

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2

## Technical Notes
[Optional: Implementation hints, constraints, related code]

## References
- PR: [link if exists]
- Wiki: [link if exists]
- Related: [IDENTIFIER]
```

---

## Label Taxonomy

**Query labels first using your adapter's API.**

| Category | Example Labels | When to Use |
|----------|----------------|-------------|
| **Type** | `bug`, `enhancement`, `feature` | Every issue needs a type |
| **Severity** | `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low` | For bugs affecting production |
| **Source** | `support`, `internal`, `customer` | Where request originated |
| **Area** | `backend`, `frontend`, `infrastructure` | Technical domain |

---

## Workflow States

Configure workflow states for your platform. Common patterns:

| State | Use When |
|-------|----------|
| Triage / New | New issues needing review |
| Backlog | Prioritized but not scheduled |
| Ready / Todo | Ready for current sprint |
| In Progress | Actively being worked |
| Done / Closed | Completed |
| Canceled / Won't Fix | Will not be done |

---

## Duplicate Detection

<EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>

**Before creating ANY issue, search for duplicates using your adapter's search operation.**

**If potential duplicate found:**

1. STOP — do not create new issue
2. Report to user: "Found existing issue [IDENTIFIER] with similar title"
3. Ask: "Should I add a comment to the existing issue instead?"

</EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>

---

## Pre-Flight Checklist

```bash
Before creating issue:
1. SEARCH — Check for duplicates
2. VALIDATE — Labels and assignee exist
3. VERIFY REFS — Run issue-verify for issue identifiers/URLs in description
4. FORMAT — Title follows standards
5. STRUCTURE — Description has required sections
6. CREATE — Only then call adapter's create operation
```

---

## Companion Skills

- **issue-editing**: Fetch-before-edit workflow
- **issue-link-verification**: Verify URLs before posting
- **issue-comment-debunker**: Evidence-based comments only

- **issue-verify**: Post-creation verification

## Example

```bash
# Create a well-structured issue in your configured tracker
# Required: title, description with acceptance criteria, team assignment
node ~/.codex/superpowers-augment/superpowers-augment.js use-skill issue-authoring
```

## Failure Modes

- **Vague titles:** "Fix bug" or "Update thing" — titles must be specific and actionable (max 80 chars)
- **Missing acceptance criteria:** Issue created without clear definition of done
- **Unverified links:** Including URLs in description without checking they resolve (see link-verification skill)
