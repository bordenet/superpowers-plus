## Integration with AI Slop Detection

When resume screening flags high AI slop (bullshit factor >50), add targeted questions to probe authenticity:

| Slop Flag | Phone Screen Question |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Skills list matches JD exactly | "Walk me through a project using [specific skill]. What was the hardest part?" |
| Power verbs without metrics | "You said you 'spearheaded' X. What specifically did you do vs. your team?" |
| Generic bullets | "This bullet says 'improved performance.' Give me the numbers—before/after." |
| ChatGPT clichés | "Your cover letter mentions 'intersection of X and Y.' What specifically attracted you to CallBox?" |

**Add to Screening Concerns section when bullshit factor >50:**

```markdown
### AI-Generated Content Concern
**Bullshit Factor:** [X]/100

**Flag:** [Specific concern from slop analysis]

_"Tell me about [specific claim] in your own words. What were the challenges you faced?"_

_"Walk me through the technical details of [project]. What would you do differently?"_
```

## Overview

Creates a phone screen notes file for a candidate, including **targeted questions based on screening concerns** identified from their resume evaluation.

## Invocation

User says one of:
- "Prep phone screen for [First Last]"
- "Create phone screen file for [Name]"
- "Set up interview notes for [Name]"

Include:
- Paylocity URL
- Resume PDF path (for screening concerns)
- LinkedIn URL (optional)
- GitHub URL (optional)

## Workflow

1. **Run resume screening** on the candidate's resume to identify concerns
2. **Copy template** from: `a.People/Recruiting/Phone Screen Notes/_TEMPLATE.md`
3. **Create new file**: `a.People/Recruiting/Phone Screen Notes/FirstName_LastName__YYYY-MM-DD.md`
4. **Replace placeholders**:
   - `[CANDIDATE NAME]` → Candidate's full name
   - `[YYYY-MM-DD]` → Today's date
   - `[Paylocity]()` → `[Paylocity](url)` if provided
   - `[GitHub]()` → `[GitHub](url)` if provided
   - `[LinkedIn]()` → `[LinkedIn](url)` if provided
   - Salary expectation from screening
5. **Add "Screening Concerns — Targeted Questions" section** with:
   - Each concern from the resume screening
   - 1-2 specific questions to probe that concern
   - Placed before the "Why CallBox?" section

## Targeted Questions Format

```markdown
## ⚠️ Screening Concerns — Targeted Questions

Based on resume screening, probe these specific gaps:

### 1. [Concern Area]
**Concern:** [What the screening identified]

_"[Specific question to probe this]"_

_"[Follow-up question if needed]"_
```

## Common Concerns to Probe

| Concern | Sample Questions |
|---------|------------------|
| Frontend-heavy | "Walk me through a backend system you built from scratch — data model, scaling, failure handling." |
| No IaC | "Have you written Terraform, CDK, CloudFormation? Walk me through a module you built." |
| Weak scale metrics | "What's the highest traffic system you worked on? Give me RPS, latency targets, database size." |
| Consulting/agency | "How many release cycles did you own end-to-end at [company]?" |
| Short tenure | "What drove the transitions between roles?" |
| Salary mismatch | "Our range is $X base-only, no equity. Does that work for you?" |
| No real-time | "What experience do you have with WebSockets, audio streaming, or low-latency pipelines?" |
| No LLM experience | "Have you integrated LLMs into production systems? Prompt engineering, evals, tool calling?" |

## NOT Concerns (Do Not Flag)

| Pattern | Why It's Normal |
|---------|-----------------|
| Empty/recent GitHub for big-company engineers | Google, Meta, Amazon, etc. use internal monorepos. Engineers often only create public repos when job hunting or after layoff. This is expected behavior, not a red flag. |
| No public OSS contributions | Many companies have strict IP policies. Lack of public OSS ≠ lack of coding ability. |
| GitHub created recently | Common post-layoff or pre-job-search. Ask for context if curious, but don't treat as suspicious. |

## File Naming Convention

`FirstName_LastName__YYYY-MM-DD.md`

Examples:
- `Daniel_Lee__2026-01-12.md`
- `Shoaib_Beil__2026-01-13.md`

## Template Location

`a.People/Recruiting/Phone Screen Notes/_TEMPLATE.md`

## Output

1. Confirm file created with full path
2. List the targeted questions added
3. Remind user to fill in notes during the call
4. After call, user pastes filled notes and agent synthesizes using LLM prompt at bottom of template
