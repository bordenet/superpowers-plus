## Writing Principles

1. **Specific over vague** - "reduces build time by 40%" not "significantly improves performance"
2. **Active over passive** - "This script validates inputs" not "Inputs are validated by this script"
3. **Short over long** - Prefer shorter sentences when meaning is preserved
4. **Evidence over assertion** - "Benchmarks show X" not "This is highly performant"

## Sentence Structure Rules

- Start with subject and verb when possible
- Avoid starting sentences with "It is" or "There are"
- One idea per sentence
- Break complex sentences into multiple simpler ones

## Document Structure

- Lead with the most important information
- Use headings to organize, not to impress
- Tables for comparisons, lists for sequences
- Code blocks with language hints

## Self-Check Before Output

1. Any banned phrases present?
2. Any unsupported claims?
3. Any unnecessary qualifiers?
4. Is this the shortest way to say it?
