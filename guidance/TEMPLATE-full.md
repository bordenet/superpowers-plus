## 🚀 Superpowers Integration

At the START of every conversation, run:

```bash
node ~/.codex/superpowers-augment/superpowers-augment.js bootstrap
```

### Key Skills

| Skill | When to Invoke |
|-------|---------------|
| `superpowers:brainstorming` | Before creative/feature work |
| `superpowers:systematic-debugging` | Before fixing bugs |
| `superpowers:test-driven-development` | Before writing implementation |
| `superpowers:verification-before-completion` | Before claiming done |
| `superpowers:writing-plans` | Before multi-step tasks |
| `superpowers:perplexity-research` | After 2+ failed attempts, or when uncertain |

**The Rule**: IF A SKILL APPLIES (even 1% chance), YOU MUST INVOKE IT.

### 🔍 Perplexity Auto-Triggers

Invoke `superpowers:perplexity-research` when:
- 2+ failed attempts at same operation
- About to guess at an answer
- Unsure about API/library/fact
- Post-training-cutoff topic
- Can't interpret error message

## ✍️ Communication Standards

- **No flattery** - Skip "Great question!" or "Excellent point!"
- **No hype words** - Avoid "revolutionary", "game-changing", "cutting-edge"
- **Evidence-based** - Cite sources, provide data, or qualify as opinion
- **Direct** - State facts without embellishment

### Banned Phrases

| Category | Avoid |
|----------|-------|
| Self-Promotion | production-grade, world-class, enterprise-ready, best-in-class |
| Hype Words | game-changing, revolutionary, cutting-edge, transformative, groundbreaking |
| Filler Boosters | incredibly, extremely, highly, truly, absolutely, very, really |
| Vague Quality | robust, seamless, comprehensive, holistic, elegant, powerful |
| AI Tells | leverage, utilize, facilitate, enable, empower, streamline, optimize |
| Sycophancy | Great question!, Happy to help!, Excellent point!, Absolutely! |

### Writing Principles

1. **Specific over vague** - "reduces build time by 40%" not "significantly improves performance"
2. **Active over passive** - "This script validates inputs" not "Inputs are validated"
3. **Short over long** - Prefer shorter sentences when meaning is preserved
4. **Evidence over assertion** - "Benchmarks show X" not "This is highly performant"

## 🔒 Security Rules

### Pre-Commit Hooks - NEVER BYPASS

```bash
# ❌ NEVER
git commit --no-verify

# ✅ ALWAYS
git commit  # Let hooks run
```

### Secret Management

- NEVER commit secrets to git
- Use environment variables for API keys
- Use `.env.local` files (gitignored)

---

## ✅ Quality Gates

### Before Committing

1. **Lint**: `[LINT_COMMAND]`
2. **Build**: `[BUILD_COMMAND]` (ALWAYS after lint)
3. **Test**: `[TEST_COMMAND]`
4. **Coverage**: Minimum [XX]%

### Before Pushing

- [ ] All tests pass locally
- [ ] No linting errors
- [ ] No secrets in code
- [ ] Commit messages are descriptive

### Before Deploying

```bash
# Step 1: Push
git push origin main

# Step 2: WAIT for CI green ✓
# DO NOT proceed until all checks pass

# Step 3: Deploy only after green
[DEPLOY_COMMAND]
```

---

## 🛠️ Build Hygiene

- **Never modify source in place** during builds
- **Always run `[BUILD_COMMAND]` after linting** - linter may pass but code won't compile
- Clean build when stuck: `[CLEAN_COMMAND]`
- Commit lock files for reproducible builds
